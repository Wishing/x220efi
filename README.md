# x220efi
I have a x220 , I was very happy because http://x220.mcdonnelltech.com/  continuously update macos installation guide.
But all the happiness was gone while the team decide to stop support the new 10.14 mojave version..
I have to make my x220 update to mojave, So this repository was here.
Letâ€™s go
1. prepare

2. install

3. upgrade

4. post install

5. other tweaks
